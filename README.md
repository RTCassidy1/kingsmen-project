This project is a solution to the following exercise from Kinsmen-Software

Project:

We would like you to create a web page that displays 10,000 rows of data in a grid.  The data itself, how it is presented, persisted, loaded, and served is all up to you!  Here are some high-level guidelines to keep you progressing:

UI Framework
{React}
Server Platform
{Node} 
Database Platform
{NoSQL} - MongoDB
Infrastructure/Platform
{Local} - Dockerized containers (could be deployed to cloud)

Over the course of a one to two-hour meeting, please be prepared to discuss your design, your technology selections, how you handled the data, and your choices for presenting the data.

For additional discussion topics, think about additional UI functionality including but not limited to search, filtering and grouping.

Keep in mind:
While this may seem formal, we would like to this to be somewhat informal to see how we can work together discussing how you approach a software delivery ask, however contrived.
Your thought process is important to us, if you have questions, ask!
We will be playing the role of the team lead and interviewer to help keep the session interactive. 
We are heavy modelers, so if you like to express design through models, please do.
While you may be a little nervous, please remember to have fun!

This is an opportunity for us to understand your thought process, engineering skillset and ability to communicate your ideas. It is also an opportunity for you to learn more about our team and if you feel that there is a fit.
